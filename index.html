        Time is like a sword. If you do not cut it, it will cut you. </br>

            Some may understand that time represents a mere measure such as seconds, minutes, hours, or years, and this is considered only the period of time, as the concept of time destroys the spirit of initiative, frustrates creative impulses, and does not achieve completion in the allotted time. If we have a week to accomplish a specific task, we will It takes a week, and if we were given ten days to complete it, it would take ten days.<br>
             The tasks increase and contract to accommodate all the time allocated to them.<br>
             These are some of the suggestions through which you can enjoy your free time:
            <ul>
                    <li>
                        <b>Exercise</b> even if you are satisfied with your weight
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Go out into the open air</b> and try to contemplate the nature around you. Listen to the sound of the birds, contemplate the sky, whether it is clear or cloudy, and contemplate the diversity and harmony of colors around you. You will realize that you are part of this vast universe that God created so that you can enjoy it and enjoy everything that God has made available for your happiness.</li>
                    <li><b>Hang up the phone and go meet your friends somewhere</b>, and be sure to talk about all the fun things in life.</li>

                Islam has considered a Muslim’s free time a great blessing that deserves appreciation and investment. <br>
                It is an appropriate opportunity to renew activity, relax oneself, and sharpen one’s resolve.<br>
                Rather, it is a manifestation of honoring the human being and appreciating his efforts. <br>
                 This is why Islam warns us against wasting free time and not appreciating its blessing. <br>
                  In the noble hadith narrated by Ibn Abbas, may God be pleased with them both, he said: The Messenger of God, may God bless him and grant him peace, said: (There are two blessings of which many people are neglected: health and free time). Health among Muslims - and they are available to young people - is one of the greatest blessings that is often wasted and wasted at the lowest prices and most trivial concerns. Therefore, the Prophet’s guidance came calling us to benefit from it in the correct manner through useful and enjoyable activities in a way that enhances the support of the believer’s personality and his commitment to his value and virtues, and develops in him the love of giving and service.
                <br> Community, and advice for every Muslim.

                <div class="datalist">
                    <ul>
<li>
    <b>The mosque</b>: There are many experiences that we cannot learn in school or in the family, such as learning to recite the Qur’an, how to pray in congregation, and answering some jurisprudential questions.
</li>                        
<li><b>Training courses</b>: Linking to training courses that will develop culture and occupy free time to the benefit and benefit, including computer courses, first aid courses, the English language, or learning a noble sport such as swimming or horse riding.</li>                        <li><b>Visiting friends and relatives</b>, as this helps with social rapprochement, entertainment, and amusement.</li>
<li><b>Family ties</b>: Allocate some free time for parents to meet with their children. The family is an educational institution in which ways of thinking and expression are absorbed, and in which religion, language, traditions, customs, and the way of speaking are acquired. Children must feel warmth and affection from their parents, and this helps them spend their free time together in an organized manner, and this should include activities that children love and prefer, such as sports, artistic activities, games, and cultural competitions.</li>
